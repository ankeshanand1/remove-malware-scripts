# Remove Malware Scripts
Scripts for quick removal of Malwares from your Server OR Desktop

**Ubuntu:**
```
wget -O quick.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankeshanand1/remove-malware-scripts/main/ubuntu/quick.sh && chmod 755 quick.sh && sudo ./quick.sh
```
The Script Primarily tries to resolve Network Errors and APT Errors caused by the Malwares and then Cleans them.

**NOTE:** The File Directly removes the malwares rather than quarantine them.
